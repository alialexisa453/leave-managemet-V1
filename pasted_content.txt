Here is your perfect, ready-to-copy Lovable prompt to generate the entire MVP for the Leave Management System.
It’s clean, structured, and includes everything Lovable needs — pages, logic, roles, calendar system, UI layout, backend schema, and workflows.
🚀 LOVABLE PROMPT — Leave Management System (Full MVP Build)
Copy + Paste into Lovable:
TITLE:
Leave Management System — Staff Self-Service Leave Portal (MVP)
DESCRIPTION / BUILD PROMPT:
I want you to build a complete MVP web application called Leave Management System (LMS).
This system is used by staff, supervisors, admins, and HR in a cleaning/FM company to apply for leave, approve requests, and manage leave day availability.
The app must include:
✅ 1. Technology Requirements
Full-stack web app

✅ 2. Authentication
Users must log in with:
Name
Company ID
Password
On first login, users set their password.
Roles must be automatically assigned from the Users table:
staff
supervisor
admin
hr
Redirect based on role to the correct dashboard.
✅ 3. Dashboard (Hero Section)
The main dashboard should have:
A hero calendar with color-coded leave availability:
Green — available days
Red — full / no more slots
Yellow — user’s pending request days
Blue — user’s approved leave days
Gray — past days
The calendar is central to the app.
Dashboard Cards:
Leave balance
Pending applications
Approved leave count
Project leave limit (per day)
